create more scan profiles (see https://github.com/perfectra1n/AutoBountyRecon/blob/master/config/port-scan-profiles.toml for ideas)
add OS enum: windows, FreeBSD, Linux, solaris
add enum for pop3, imap, kerberos, ldap, msrpc, rtmp, cups. AD enum(?)
add eyewitness to scan all ports on http and directories (maybe)
make it so that if a tool required is not installed, install it
make sure tools are up-to-date. if not update
make gobuster dir recursive only for 200s 1 lvl
add some of my other tools maybe(?) i.e grepkrawler for sites, sonar dns(?), etc.
if no arg is passed, run tool as "shell" (SET format ...ish)
add support for hostnames and check if an IP is being passed, if not refer to help menu
add usage modules. (kinda like gobuster....maybe)
add "multi-processes" (i know you know what i mean)
