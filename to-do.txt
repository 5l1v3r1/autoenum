create more scan profiles (see https://github.com/perfectra1n/AutoBountyRecon/blob/master/config/port-scan-profiles.toml for ideas)
add OS enum: windows, FreeBSD, Linux, solaris
add enum for pop3, imap, kerberos, ldap, rpc, rtmp, cups, mysql, sip(?) AD enum(?)

add some of my other tools maybe(?) i.e grepkrawler for sites, sonar dns(?), etc.
